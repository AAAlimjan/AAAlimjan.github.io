<p>I am testing image on hexo.<img src="https://github.com/AAAlimjan/PersonalDiary/blob/master/Diary%202020/entropy.jpg" alt="Entropy"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200115, 21:30, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Recently I am reading Shannon’s biography, having a lot of interest in information theory especially his theories on cryptography &amp; information measurement. I think I have never been thinking this much about information theory before. After finishing his biography, I’m gonna try to read his papers, and study his main ideas.</p>
<p>Office work was busy in the morning, made a form &amp; write a summary.</p>
<p>This afternoon there was a rehearsal about the Chinese New Year that is happening this Friday.But I didn’t know what time we were going, so I was left out in office alone😅 .So around 15:30 I left and went to Binjiangdao for shopping. I bought Adidas jacket and shoes as a gift.</p>
<p>Had dinner at Ayile, that beef with pumpkin souse was super delicious.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200116, 18:55, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I woke up late again &amp; had a meeting with my supervisor till 10.  Also was reading about trade pact just signed, there was different opinions. But my interest was surprisingly, there was not nothing much on media, it was predictable yet scary for me.</p>
<p>After lunch from 1 pm - 2 pm we were still had rehearsal &amp; it was boring since that old lady made us practice again and again. 😶</p>
<p>At lunch I was surprisingly found out that my  window was shut down (or wasn’t open at dinner), because it was just 17:34 when I was in &amp; usually it shuts down at 20:30. I estimate at least 500 students still in school. So students needs food among them was neglected. And I do not know what to think.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200117, 17:35, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>In the morning I was leave the room around 7:25, again no hot lunch &amp; supermarket was shutdown. So I stood hungry till lunch. Meeting was as usual &amp; but boring.<br>
In the afternoon we performed at the 7th. My sound was loud and we were bit late for the rhythm. It went down well anyway.<br>
Now the winter vacation begins.<br>
After finishing birthday celebration &amp; moving my stuff I will make a plan for this vacation. I am thinking about making <em><strong>challenge list</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200118, 21:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I slept till 11:31am! that’s how my winter vacation started. I didn’t have breakfast &amp; had that Japanese noodles for lunch, after that I went to campus to clean my room, washed my shoes &amp; came back here(Hexi).</p>
<p>At night  I was reading Shannon’s biography &amp; played little billiard on my phone.Also discovered a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_future_we_re_building_and_boring">TED video</a> about Elon  Musk where he talk about his projects and views about the future which I found inspiring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I’m not trying to be anyone’s savior. That is not the – I’m just trying to think about the future and not be sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What’s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we’re not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it’s incredibly depressing if that’s not the future that we’re going to have.</p>

<p><strong>20200119, 20:03, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I stayed at home the whole day and learned <a href="http://Mathematics.It">Mathematics.It</a> is mainly about limits and calculations of limits.</p>
<p>Then I finished Shannon’s biography, started to read “The Three Body Problem” which is famous, why I am reading it is massively because Nature also recommended this book, is not, I think I wouldn’t read it.</p>
<p>Then I ordered a memory chip online(4G) to increase my laptop’s RAM, cuz I bought it on January 4th of 2013, so I have been using it for 7 years and it is slow.</p>
<p>I was unsure about going to Binjiangdao for changing the shoes or no, then  figured that it is Sunday &amp; it must be crowded out there, so decided to go tomorrow. Because of this hesitation, I had lunch at 3-ish from  Bayghujam, rice noodles &amp; lamp soup with a barbecue.</p>
<p>At night she came back exhausted &amp; hungry, I ordered sushi 🍣 for her.Then went to bed around 9.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200120, 22:03, Tianjin</strong><br>
In the morning, I went to BJD on foot to change that shoes I bought for my gf. It took around 40 minutes to get there, it turns that color difference was a design, and I changed for another same shoes.</p>

In the morning, I went to BJD on foot to change that shoes I bought for my gf. It took around 40 minutes to get there, it turns that color difference was a design, and I changed for another same 
In the evening, I bought fried chicken & potato & milk beer for dinner. After that watch *Shameless* S10E11, my gf came back late (11pm) and woke me up. She had dinner with colleagues & that was too stupid & suffering for her. 
<p>From how understand is that, that managers never asked these foreign teachers what they want and they also was never be able to understand their feeling. They played stupid drinking game &amp; ate nasty food. (a 🐸 come on! ).</p>
<p>Were chatting at night late &amp; I was not happy. She was working like the bottom and she was so unable to understand my feelings, this is hard point,  always.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200121, 22:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I was relaxed in the morning &amp; was studying mathematics.Put my books in order &amp; cleaned up the room.</p>
<p>Around lunch time my GF ordered lunch for  me (fried rice) &amp; asked me to cut 🍅&amp;🥒to eat with it. That was sweet &amp; warm the way she said it.</p>
<p>Then I looked at gyms near this apartment &amp; found BlackSails, but she insisted that this gym is somehow unworthy &amp; used for looking for hookups,  strongly objected me going there. Therefore, around 3 I went out to find a gym near line 5, near school. Then found one, Romans. But didn’t bought gym card this fast Cuz thinking maybe I can exercise outside near Haihe, without spending money, since I can use that money for buying equipment.</p>
<p>The new kind of virus found in Wuhan was serious &amp; I was thinking about how it started, I mean Chinese eat almost everything &amp; now human activity changed animals a lot, too.</p>
<p>And I must use my vacation more seriously, I felt like I am too relaxed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="February">February</h2>
<p><strong>20200207, 20:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>We bought water &amp; vegetables, take-away food from that supermarket and 711. Get our body temperature measured &amp; registered our name &amp; phone number before shopping in 711. I think if someone confirmed to be infected they will call by that list &amp; take people to hospital for quarantine. She relaxed all day.</p>
<p>Watched video about Geoffrey Hinton &amp;  AI.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200208, 21:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>The quarantine is getting more &amp; more strict. Today  around 3pm her phone rang &amp; I answered as usual since sometimes she can’t understand when Chinese speak too fast, it was from the police station near us and asked about whether we went out during this epidemic &amp; what is our ID number balabala, then because I felt not right but I couldn’t just make up an identity &amp; passport number in two seconds so I told them my identity &amp; ID number.</p>
<p>After like one hour two policemen came, took picture of  me &amp; asked that humiliating &amp; stupid question, such as where I work, when I came here, when I will leave &amp; weather I leaved town during this epidemic.</p>
<p>Despite the systematic humiliation &amp; discrimination, racial profiling, and cold &amp; toxic silence of the majority of Chinese people, today I was thinking about two things: Coronavirus &amp; Stanford Prison Experiment.</p>
<p>I read a quote by Heinrich Heine says ：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where they have burned books, they will end in burning human beings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember during the October of 2017, including me and that people burned many books that identifies or expresses our culture &amp; identity willingly or forced. Among books I burned there was classic books that I kept as a treasure for many years including Abduhaliq’s poem collection, Abduqader Jalalidin’s essays, calligraphy books, books about culture &amp; historic novels, because I feared that I wound be taken &amp; set to some awful places if someone told them I have those books or if they find out in any random chance. That active book burning was a crime on my concise, and I feel the fear &amp; surviving desire so much powerful comparing to the delusion that I usually presume that I have nobility in my internal world that I seek truth &amp; beauty, I will sacrifice my life for science &amp; social values.</p>
<p>When I thought about myself being in a confined cell or a iron bared  “change or perish” kind of camp, I was afraid. I choose to burn that books &amp; strengthen my safety &amp; create something more than that books have contained.</p>
<p>They did burn books &amp; forced us in various forms, to burn books. Shockingly, now they are burning humans indeed, without revealing the truth about them &amp; it seems to be continued.</p>
<p>It feels to me that there is a kind of conservation law of evil in human beings, like when someone or someones do evil things to a group they will be treated as such one way the other. The world destroyed &amp; humiliated the Jewish people in the history &amp; now they are taking what’s theirs with blood and force. The Chinese was killed &amp;  being bullied for decades now they are doing the same. It feels to me like justice is for the weak &amp; might makes right. Fancy concepts like human value and rights at most of the cases are not something that we worship but one that we consume to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>I lost my faith in the world that I imagined in my naive mind these hard working people of this land have a good heart &amp; they stand for righteousness, no, their concept of truth or whatever the concept that originated from European renaissance is feed on material needs. Stomach determines the brain &amp; imagination of living a decent human life with human dignity. People worship &amp; practice Materialism &amp; Marxism, unreasonably almost all of them, like that are preprogrammed that way when the came out of the big scary factory.</p>
<p>We are the slaves of our soul.</p>
