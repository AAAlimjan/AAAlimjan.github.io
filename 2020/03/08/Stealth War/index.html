<li>“War is a mere continuation of policy by other means.”<br>
Carl von Clausewitz, a German military theorist, wrote those words two centuries ago. He was referring to “public policy,” another name for “politics.” Military scholars, then, generally interpret this statement as saying that “politics” and “war” are synonymous. And that means politics can be viewed as a continuation of war by other means.</li>
