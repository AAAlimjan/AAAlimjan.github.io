            <p>哲学即对智慧的  爱慕。</p>
<p>1.哲学是什么?</p>
<p>哲学是起源于古希腊的一种认识世界的方法论。其特点是思辨，不像宗教：毋庸置疑的相信造物主。哲学里没有任何预先认为准确的规则。</p>
<p>值得注意的是，当哲学开始出现的年代世界各处多种思想争鸣着，比如亚洲开始出现佛教。</p>
<p>当初哲学是所有通过思辨认识世界的学科的总和，科学后来分出来的。</p>
<p>哲学是对话性质的学科，永远没有最终答案，没有输家，它不向任何其他学科。它讲究如何思考，如何接近真理。</p>
<p>哲学会改善一个人的生活，哲学改变世界，哲学家的对话可以延续几千年但始终找不到答案。</p>
<p>2.如何思辨?</p>
<p>哲学家运用一系列标准的思考方法和工具与彼此对话。哲学对话不像键盘侠们相互撕逼哦。</p>
<p>how deductive arguments work (and sometimes don’t work)：</p>
<p>三段论推理 是常见的一种演绎推理方法。</p>
<p>induction and abduction &amp; Socratic method.</p>
<p>3.小李子和现实的属性</p>
<p>“黑客帝国”里的深层哲学。</p>
<p>到底什么事“真实”？盲人摸大象的比喻。</p>
<p>relationship between appearance and reality.</p>
<p>Plato’s famous Myth of the Cave &amp; Matrix</p>
<p>4.笛卡尔式怀疑论 - 尼奥&amp;笛卡尔</p>
<p>skepticism: i think therfore i am.</p>
<p>怀疑一切，除了知道自己在怀疑其他什么都不知道。</p>
<p>5.洛克，伯克利和经验主义</p>
<p>反驳笛卡尔。</p>
<p>answering skeptics like Descartes with empiricism.</p>
<p>John Locke’s primary and secondary qualities and why George Berkeley doesn’t think that distinction works introducing :存在即被感知。</p>
<p>leaving us with literally nothing but our minds, ideas, and perceptions.</p>
<p>唯心主义哲学的经典。</p>
<p>6.什么是知识？</p>
<p>the key concepts philosophers use when discussing belief and knowledge, such as what defines an assertion and a proposition, and that belief is a kind of propositional attitude.</p>
<p>also discusses forms of justification and the traditional definition of knowledge</p>
<p>（justified true belief）</p>
<p>which Edmund Gettier just totally messed with, using his Gettier cases.(being locked to be right)</p>
<p>7.卡尔波普尔：科学&amp;伪科学</p>
<p>KP was born as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Albert Einstein was developing his theories of relativity (physics)<br>
Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis took over the scientific mainstream (psychology )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Karl Popper observed these developments firsthand and came to draw a distinction between what he referred to as science and pseudoscience, which might best be summarized as science disconfirms, while pseudoscience confirms.</p>
<p>Popper’s ideas speak to the heart of how we arrive at knowledge.</p>
<p>在他之前没人认真看过分析过科学发展的“范式”</p>
<p>8.安瑟伦，与论证上帝</p>
<p>philosophy of religion</p>
<p>Anselm’s argument for God’s existence, while also considering objections to that argument.</p>
<p>9.阿奎纳与论证宇宙</p>
<p>the cosmological arguments.</p>
<p>10.智慧设计</p>
<p>intelligent design</p>
<p>the teleological argument, and the ensuing dialogue it initiated.</p>
<p>为什么地球刚好在离太阳距离完美的一个点上？</p>
<p>11.上帝长什么样？</p>
<p>the philosophical debate surrounding the traditional divine attributes of God  -omnipotence, omniscience,omni temporality, and omnibenevolence.（相互不自洽）</p>
<p>exploring the puzzles that these attributes create as well as some possible solutions to those puzzles, from Aquinas’ ideas of analogical predication, to the work of Eleanor Stump.</p>
<p>【悖论】上帝能创造一个自己都拿不动的石头吗？</p>
<p>12.恶的问题</p>
<p>one of the biggest problems in theism, and possibly the biggest philosophical question humanity faces: why is there evil?</p>
<p>【威胁宗教哲学的一个巨大的问题】</p>
<p>14.阴谋论&amp;认知责任</p>
<p>explore what obligations we hold with our personal beliefs.</p>
<p>the issues it raises with everything from religious belief, to ship owning, to vaccinations.</p>
<p>知者，必须知行合一。</p>
<p>15.帕斯卡的赌注</p>
<p>Indiana Jones to explain religious pragmatism and Pascal’s Wager, fideism, and Kierkegaard’s leap to faith.</p>
<p>【选择上帝存在的赌注赢得概率最大】</p>
<p>16.存在主义</p>
<p>leaving behind the philosophy of religion, it’s time to start exploring what other ways might exist to find meaning in the world.</p>
<p>explore essentialism and its response: existentialism.</p>
<p>also learn about Jean-Paul Sartre and his ideas about how to find meaning in a meaningless world.</p>
<p>（we define the meaning in life）</p>
<p>我们是自己生命意义的设计师</p>
<p>17.如何看待死亡</p>
<p>talking about death, looking at philosophical approaches from Socrates, Epicurus, and Zhuangzi.  consider whether it’s logical to fear your own death, or the deaths of your loved ones.</p>
<p>also discusses Thomas Nagel, death, and Fear of Missing Out.</p>
<p>庄子梦蝶，亲人死去要开心。</p>
<p>18.蝙蝠侠&amp;人格的哲学</p>
<p>different ways of understanding identity – including the Indiscernibility of Identicals, and essential and accidental properties. In what ways does affect identity? In what ways does it not? What does it mean for a thing to persist over time?</p>
<p>蝙蝠侠到底是保护神还是富二代？他的斗风在隐藏什么？身份如何延续？如何保持？</p>
<p>19.自我身份</p>
<p>focus on personal identity. Does it in reside in your body? Is it in the collective memories of your consciousness? There are, of course, strengths and weaknesses to both of these ideas, and that’s what we’re talking about today.</p>
<p>砍掉多少部分你才变成另外一个人？</p>
<p>20.人格问题的一些反驳</p>
<p>How can Daenerys Targaryen help us understand personal identity?</p>
<p>Find out as Hank continues our exploration of personal identity, learning about Hume’s bundle theory and Parfit’s theory of survival through Psychological connectedness.</p>
<p>21.人性</p>
<p>tackles the question of personhood. Philosophers have tried to assess what constitutes personhood with a variety of different criteria, including genetic, cognitive, social, sentience, and the gradient theory. As with many of philosophy’s great questions, this has much broader implications than simple conjecture. The way we answer this question informs all sorts of things about the way we move about the world, including our views on some of our greatest social debates.</p>
<p>22.意识在哪里？</p>
<p>continue our unit on identity by asking where the mind resides.</p>
<p>explains the mind body problem and several approaches to the question of where our minds reside, including reductive physicalism, substance dualism, and mysterianism.</p>
<p><a href="http://23.AI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23.AI</a> &amp; 人性</p>
<p>the various ways that thinkers have tried to define strong AI including  the Turing Test, and John Searle’s response(the system knows Chinese) to the Turing Test, the Chinese Room.</p>
<p>is his brother John a robot?</p>
<p>24.决定论&amp;自由意志</p>
<p>Do we really have free will?</p>
<p>explores possible answers to that question, explaining theories like libertarian free will and it’s counterpoint, hard determinism.</p>
<p>25.相容论</p>
<p>.As continue exploring free will, today considers a middle ground between hard determinism and libertarian free will: compatibilism.</p>
<p>This view seeks to find ways that our internally motivated actions can be understood as free in a deterministic world. We’ll also cover Frankfurt Cases and Patricia Churchland’s rejection of the free-or-not-free dichotomy and her focus on the amount of control we have over our actions.</p>
<p>26.语言&amp;意义</p>
<p>Today we start our unit on language with a discussion of meaning and how we assign and understand meaning. We’ll cover sense and reference, beetles in boxes, and language games. We’re also getting into the meaning-making game ourselves: bananas are now chom-choms. Pass it on.</p>
<p>27.言外之意</p>
<p>Last week we talked about language and meaning. Today, Hank explores some of the things that complicate meaning and how we get around that. We’ll explain conversational implicature, the cooperative principle, and the four main maxims of successful communication, as laid out by Paul Grice, as well as performative utterances.</p>
<p>28.语言如何伤人</p>
<p>Content warning: today’s episode contains language that some viewers might find upsetting and that may not be viewable in all settings. We’ve talking about how language works and how powerful it can be. Sometimes, that power can be harmful. Today, Hank explains the use/mention distinction, the difference between dirty words and hate speech, as well as thick concepts and metaphorical identification.</p>
<p>29.幻象物体和虚拟世界</p>
<p>Today we transition between units on language and aesthetics with a discussion of nonexistent and imaginary objects. Is it possible to make true assertions about things that aren’t real? We’ll explore Meinong’s Jungle and the concept of a universe of discourse.</p>
<p>30.美学欣赏</p>
<p>Today we are talking about art and aesthetic appreciation. What makes something an artwork? Can art really be defined? Is aesthetic value is objective or subjective? Can taste be developed? How?</p>
<p>31.美学</p>
<p>How do art and morality intersect? Today we look at an ethically questionable work of art and discuss R. G. Collingwood’s view that art is best when it helps us live better lives. We’ll go over Aristotle’s concept of catharsis and how it can resolve the problem of tragedy. We are also exploring the paradox of fiction and the debate between autonomism and moralism.</p>
<p>32.元伦理学</p>
<p>We begin our unit on ethics with a look at metaethics. Hank explains three forms of moral realism – moral absolutism, and cultural relativism, including the difference between descriptive and normative cultural relativism – and moral subjectivism, which is a form of moral antirealism. Finally, we’ll introduce the concept of an ethical theory.</p>
<p>33.神旨意理论</p>
<p>As we venture into the world of ethics, there are a lot of different answers to the grounding problem for us to explore. One of the oldest and most popular is the divine command theory. But with age comes a long history of questions, too, such as the dilemma presented by Plato known as the Euthyphro Problem.</p>
<p>34.自然法则论</p>
<p>Our exploration of ethical theories continues with another theistic answer to the grounding problem: natural law theory. Thomas Aquinas’s version of this theory says that we all seek out what’s known as the basic goods and argued that instinct and reason come together to point us to the natural law. There are, of course, objections to this theory – in particular, the is-ought problem advanced by David Hume.</p>
<p>35.康德的绝对命令论</p>
<p>Our next stop on our tour of ethics is Kant’s ethics. Today Hank explains hypothetical and categorical imperatives, the universalizability principle, autonomy, and what it means to treat people as ends-in-themselves, rather than as mere means.</p>
<p>36.功利主义</p>
<p>Our next stop in our tour of the ethical lay of the land is utilitarianism. With a little help from Batman, Hank explains the principle of utility, and the difference between act and rule utilitarianism.</p>
<p>37.契约主义</p>
<p>Today we explore the penultimate ethical theory in this unit: contractarianism. Hank explains Hobbes’ state of nature, and implicit and explicit contracts, as well as the Prisoner’s Dilemma, and the benefits, and costs, of violating contracts.</p>
<p>38.亚里士多德的美德理论</p>
<p>This week we explore final ethical theory in this unit: Aristotle’s virtue theory. Hank explains the Golden Mean, and how it exists as the midpoint between vices of excess and deficiency. We’ll also discuss moral exemplars, and introduce the concept of “eudaimonia.”</p>
<p>39.道德运气</p>
<p>Can two people who make the same bad decision bear different levels of moral responsibility? Today, we try to address this question with the concept of moral luck. Hank explains the difference between moral and causal responsibility, and the reasons we assign praise and blame.</p>
<p>40.何为公正？</p>
<p>In today’s episode, Hank asks you to consider all the ways people talk about justice and what we really mean when we use that word. We’ll explain various theories of justice, just distribution, and different approaches to punishment.</p>
<p>41.歧视</p>
<p>Is it OK to discriminate? Do you do it? Is it always wrong or are there cases where it can be acceptable? Today we’re talking through several tricky cases and different philosophical perspectives on this issue.</p>
<p>42.非人动物</p>
<p>Today we are taking all the things we have learned this year about doing philosophy and applying that to moral considerations regarding non-human animals. We’ll explore what philosophers like Peter Singer and Carl Cohen have to say about their use, including the concept of equal consideration of interests.</p>
<p>43.家庭义务</p>
<p>Today we are investigating our moral obligations to our parents and our families. Do we owe our parents anything as adults? Would it be a good idea to license parents? We’ll explore these questions as well as the ethics of care, and some potential problems that type of approach to morality carries with it.</p>
<p>44.贫困&amp;我们的回应</p>
<p>We’re picking up where we left off last time, exploring the “ethics of care” and how it applies to extreme poverty. Are we responding to global poverty in a moral way? Philosophers like Peter Singer argue that we have an obligation to prevent harm caused by poverty, whereas Garrett Hardin offers a “lifeboat analogy” to explain our obligations to focus on caring for our own.</p>
<p>45.安乐死&amp;生命之价值</p>
<p>As we wrap up Crash Course Philosophy, we’re using the things we’ve learned to explore big issues like the value of life. Today, we’re discussing abortions in cases of fetal abnormality, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. We will consider the standard of substituted judgment and the values people hold on both sides of these issues—values about the sacredness of life, and the importance of a life of quality, as well as the values of personal liberty and avoiding pain.</p>
<p>46.如何美好的生活?</p>
<p>In our final episode of Crash Course Philosophy, we consider what it means to live a good life. We’ll look at the myth of Sisyphus, Robert Nozick’s experience machine, Aristotle’s eudemonistic picture of a good human life, and the existentialists’ view that we each determine the value of our own lives. And we’ll think about how you, too, can live the life of a philosopher.</p>
