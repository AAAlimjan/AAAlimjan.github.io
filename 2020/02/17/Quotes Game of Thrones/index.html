<li>Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending. -Eddison Tollett</li>

<li>Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life. -Sansa Stark</li>

<li>Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear. -Tyrion Lannister</li>
<li>We still have to take King’s Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems. -Tyrion Lannister</li>
<li>You think I’m a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life, for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands, just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun, for Cersei. She’s hateful. And so am I.  -Jaime Lannister</li>

<li><strong>Love is more powerful than reason.  -Tyrion Lannister</strong></li>
<li>What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. <strong>There’s nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it.</strong> And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he’d never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?  -Tyrion Lannister</li>
<li>No one is very happy. Which means it’s a good compromise. -Tyrion Lannister</li>
<li>A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world. -Tyrion Lannister</li>
<li>Why do you think I came all this way?  -Bran Stark</li>
