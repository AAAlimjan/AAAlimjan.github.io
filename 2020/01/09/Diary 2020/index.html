<p><strong>20200109, 20:42, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I am testing image on hexo.<img src="https://github.com/AAAlimjan/aaalimjan.github.io/blob/master/2020/01/09/Diary%202020/entropy.jpg" alt="Entropy"></p>

<p><strong>20200115, 21:30, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Recently I am reading Shannon’s biography, having a lot of interest in information theory especially his theories on cryptography &amp; information measurement. I think I have never been thinking this much about information theory before. After finishing his biography, I’m gonna try to read his papers, and study his main ideas.</p>
<p>Office work was busy in the morning, made a form &amp; write a summary.</p>
<p>This afternoon there was a rehearsal about the Chinese New Year that is happening this Friday. But I didn’t know what time we were going, so I was left out in office alone😅 .So around 15:30 I left and went to Binjiangdao for shopping. I bought Adidas jacket and shoes as a gift.</p>
<p>Had dinner at Ayile, that beef with pumpkin souce was super delicious.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200116, 18:55, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I woke up late again &amp; had a meeting with my supervisor till 10.  Also was reading about trade pact just signed, there was different opinions. But my interest was surprisingly, there was not nothing much on media, it was predictable yet scary for me.</p>
<p>After lunch from 1 pm - 2 pm we were still had rehearsal &amp; it was boring since that old lady made us practice again and again. 😶</p>
<p>At lunch I was surprisingly found out that my  window was shut down (or wasn’t open at dinner), because it was just 17:34 when I was in &amp; usually it shuts down at 20:30. I estimate at least 500 students still in school. So students needs food among them was neglected. And I do not know what to think.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200117, 17:35, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>In the morning I was leave the room around 7:25, again no hot lunch &amp; supermarket was shutdown. So I stood hungry till lunch. Meeting was as usual &amp; but boring.<br>
In the afternoon we performed at the 7th. My sound was loud and we were bit late for the rhythm. It went down well anyway.<br>
Now the winter vacation begins.<br>
After finishing birthday celebration &amp; moving my stuff I will make a plan for this vacation. I am thinking about making <em><strong>challenge list</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200118, 21:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I slept till 11:31am! that’s how my winter vacation started. I didn’t have breakfast &amp; had that Japanese noodles for lunch, after that I went to campus to clean my room, washed my shoes &amp; came back here(Hexi).</p>
<p>At night  I was reading Shannon’s biography &amp; played little billiard on my phone. Also discovered a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_future_we_re_building_and_boring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TED video</a> about Elon  Musk where he talk about his projects and views about the future which I found inspiring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I’m not trying to be anyone’s savior. That is not the – I’m just trying to think about the future and not be sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What’s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we’re not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that it’s incredibly depressing if that’s not the future that we’re going to have.</p>

<p><strong>20200119, 20:03, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I stayed at home the whole day and learned Mathematics. It is mainly about limits and calculations of limits.</p>
<p>Then I finished Shannon’s biography, started to read “The Three Body Problem” which is famous, why I am reading it is massively because Nature also recommended this book, is not, I think I wouldn’t read it.</p>
<p>Then I ordered a memory chip online(4G) to increase my laptop’s RAM, cuz I bought it on January 4th of 2013, so I have been using it for 7 years and it is slow.</p>
<p>I was unsure about going to Binjiangdao for changing the shoes or no, then  figured that it is Sunday &amp; it must be crowded out there, so decided to go tomorrow. Because of this hesitation, I had lunch at 3-ish from  Bayghujam, rice noodles &amp; lamp soup with a barbecue.</p>
<p>At night she came back exhausted &amp; hungry, I ordered sushi 🍣 for her. Then went to bed around 9.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200120, 22:03, Tianjin</strong><br>
In the morning, I went to BJD on foot to change that shoes I bought for my gf. It took around 40 minutes to get there, it turns that color difference was a design, and I changed for another same shoes.</p>

In the morning, I went to BJD on foot to change that shoes I bought for my gf. It took around 40 minutes to get there, it turns that color difference was a design, and I changed for another same 
In the evening, I bought fried chicken & potato & milk beer for dinner. After that watch *Shameless* S10E11, my gf came back late (11pm) and woke me up. She had dinner with colleagues & that was too stupid & suffering for her. 
<p>From how understand is that, that managers never asked these foreign teachers what they want and they also was never be able to understand their feeling. They played stupid drinking game &amp; ate nasty food.</p>
<p>Were chatting at night late &amp; I was not happy. She was working like the bottom and she was so unable to understand my feelings, this is hard point,  always.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200121, 22:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I was relaxed in the morning &amp; was studying mathematics. Put my books in order &amp; cleaned up the room.</p>
<p>Around lunch time my GF ordered lunch for  me (fried rice) &amp; asked me to cut 🍅&amp;🥒to eat with it. That was sweet &amp; warm the way she said it.</p>
<p>Then I looked at gyms near this apartment &amp; found BlackSails, but she insisted that this gym is somehow unworthy &amp; used for looking for hookups,  strongly objected me going there. Therefore, around 3 I went out to find a gym near line 5, near school. Then found one, Romans. But didn’t bought gym card this fast Cuz thinking maybe I can exercise outside near Haihe, without spending money, since I can use that money for buying equipment.</p>
<p>The new kind of virus found in Wuhan was serious &amp; I was thinking about how it started, I mean Chinese eat almost everything &amp; now human activity changed animals a lot, too.</p>
<p>And I must use my vacation more seriously, I felt like I am too relaxed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="February">February</h2>
<p><strong>20200207, 20:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>We bought water &amp; vegetables, take-away food from that supermarket and 711. Get our body temperature measured &amp; registered our name &amp; phone number before shopping in 711. I think if someone confirmed to be infected they will call by that list &amp; take people to hospital for quarantine. She relaxed all day.</p>
<p>Watched video about Geoffrey Hinton &amp;  AI.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>20200208, 21:23, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>The quarantine is getting more &amp; more strict. Today  around 3pm her phone rang &amp; I answered as usual since sometimes she can’t understand when Chinese speak too fast, it was from the police station near us and asked about whether we went out during this epidemic &amp; what is our ID number balabala, then because I felt not right but I couldn’t just make up an identity &amp; passport number in two seconds so I told them my identity &amp; ID number.</p>
<p>After like one hour two policemen came, took picture of  me &amp; asked that humiliating &amp; stupid question, such as where I work, when I came here, when I will leave &amp; weather I leaved town during this epidemic.</p>
<p>Despite the systematic humiliation &amp; discrimination, racial profiling, and cold &amp; toxic silence of the majority of Chinese people, today I was thinking about two things: Coronavirus &amp; Stanford Prison Experiment.</p>
<p>I read a quote by Heinrich Heine says ：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Where they have burned books, they will end in burning human beings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember during the October of 2017, including me and that people burned many books that identifies or expresses our culture &amp; identity willingly or forced. Among books I burned there was classic books that I kept as a treasure for many years including Abduhaliq’s poem collection, Abduqader Jalalidin’s essays, calligraphy books, books about culture &amp; historic novels, because I feared that I wound be taken &amp; set to some awful places if someone told them I have those books or if they find out in any random chance. That active book burning was a crime on my concise, and I feel the fear &amp; surviving desire so much powerful comparing to the delusion that I usually presume that I have nobility in my internal world that I seek truth &amp; beauty, I will sacrifice my life for science &amp; social values.</p>
<p>When I thought about myself being in a confined cell or a iron bared  “change or perish” kind of camp, I was afraid. I choose to burn that books &amp; strengthen my safety &amp; create something more than that books have contained.</p>
<p>They did burn books &amp; forced us in various forms, to burn books. Shockingly, now they are burning humans indeed, without revealing the truth about them &amp; it seems to be continued.</p>
<p>It feels to me that there is a kind of conservation law of evil in human beings, like when someone or some ones do evil things to a group they will be treated as such one way the other. It feels to me like justice is for the weak &amp; might makes right. Fancy concepts like human value and rights at most of the cases are not something that we worship but one that we consume to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>I lost my faith in the world that I imagined in my naïve mind these hard working people of this land have a good heart &amp; they stand for righteousness, no, their concept of truth or whatever the concept that originated from European renaissance is feed on material needs. Stomach determines the brain &amp; imagination of living a decent human life with human dignity. People worship power,  unreasonably almost all of them, like that are preprogrammed that way when the came out of the big scary factory.</p>
<p>Poor  slaves of poor souls.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>23:39 2020.2.14，Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Today is Valentine’s day, in the morning I again get up late, around 9 am. When I get up, she already ordered breakfast, she even ordered for me cocoa&amp; cake as present!<br>
Then it began to snow, like all day. So outside snow is everywhere, like real winter, like in Ukraine or Russia. But we didn’t go out.<br>
When I am doing statistics today there is one more student is reportedly has fever, he is from Baodi district, they have a lot there because of a market. Another one in Hubei, was reported for weeks but today heard now fever is gone, but still coughing, dyspnea &amp; stiffly nose, I connected this fact with that sulfur dioxide, without a why.<br>
In the evening she invited me to watch a movie, Robin Williams was the main actor, called What Dreams May Come (1998) , this movie is full of romance &amp; philosophical ideas about love in life and after death. Whole scene is full of artistic beauty &amp; imagination, for someone like art, this movie is recommended.</p>
<p>I read few sections in economy lectures &amp; what is physics books.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>02/12/2020 22:29:51, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>I received letters from Barbara, she wrote to me what she was doing &amp; asked me if we can exchange emails freely now. She mentioned she attends exercising on Monday, Tuesday&amp;Friday, she walks two miles with neighbors. I am impressed &amp; inspired by her lifestyle, she always has been a bright 🔆 figure &amp;  I can read how optimistic &amp; healthy she is through her words.</p>
<p>She is a role model in life. A woman that shines in the heart &amp; face.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>02/13/2020 21:46:05,Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Today I was interested in LSU, after reading bunch of articles from a NASA engineer.(E.S) realized that it is established in 2001 with linguists &amp; computer scientists due to convenience it will bring once if it is used inside a computer, since Arabic script is very tricky when dealing with computer systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hemme adem tughulushidinla erkin, izzet-hörmet we hoquqta babbarawer bolup tughulghan. Ular eqilge we wijdan’gha ige hemde bir-birige qërindashliq munasiwitige xas roh bilen muamile qilishi kërek.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have this alphabet ,too.⭐️</p>

<p><strong>02/15/2020 20:36:41, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Today we stayed at home as usual. But I think I woke up late, it was already 9 pm. I think mornings are not productive, much more things I promised to myself I haven’t achieved yet. I will control my time on relaxation.<br>
People are getting out to streets now, when I went to supermarket while I fetch her lunch, I saw a lot of people on street. In 711, they checked my temperature &amp; asked me to register on their log, I switched the last digit on my phone number to 2, I don’t want if someone get confirmed they took me to quarantine too, because I think hospitals are more dangerous.<br>
I got a phone call from my mom.</p>
<p>I checked &amp; downloaded lots of scientific papers for Nurgul.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>02/16/2020 18:25:53</strong>, Tianjin</p>
<p>Today she was a little not in the mood for talking to me. Yesterday I was lazy to go out to buy water &amp; in the morning after she woke up found herself pissed. Didn’t talk to me till noon &amp; I asked why, then we have argued.</p>
<p>I think she was overwhelmed by two uncertainties: one: This epidemic is still on its way. Second, when we had conversation about movies she felt like she is left out from me.  Uncertainty drives her crazy, I don’t now all women are like this or she is a rare type.</p>
<p>She thought it through though.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>02/17/2020 17:13:26，Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Today I wake up early (around 8 AM)，&amp; finished my work around 11. She made lunch &amp; I wasn’t hungry even till 4 PM. While  I was working, I played <em><strong>Game of Thrones</strong></em>, the one Cersei blew up the Red Keep &amp; kill all her enemies inside. This episode along with the BGM <em>Light of the Seven</em> is one of her favorite, she enjoys every time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>OMG, I want to watch from the beginning again! This is such a masterpiece! How they can create something like this wonderful?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the afternoon I leaned about HEXO plugins, and tried some of them. Then wrote to Barbara&amp;Karen.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>02/18/2020 20:49:30, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Today we went to shopping, we bought lots of beef😋 , vegetables , sweets, fruits &amp; dairies after I finish my work around 11. When we took her delivery &amp; finish all the shopping it was 2o’clock, then we had snacks while watching YouTube(​404​).</p>
<p>Helped her to change the manuscript &amp; submitted around 6 PM.</p>
<p>Now I am going to study mathematics &amp; read my books.📖</p>
<p>I am having thoughts about science &amp; its meaning for me, I am going to write a article on this thought 💭. Keep it up!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>02/26/2020 23:53:32, Tianjin</strong></p>
<p>Just few minutes ago,  police from this district called(15522917008) on her phone saying he need her Wechat ID because they are registering all the foreigners during the pandemic. For me that is a lie. I think they are going to check her wechat messages since she is close to me. I am so feed up being systematically discriminated, especially I am working for them. I am college graduate &amp; I work in a college, but they just don’t stop humiliating me, they never trust someone. Just as they say  &amp; worship：“非我族类，其心必异”（Who those isn’t my blood, are sure to be my enemy.）Wondering how they gonna lead the world.</p>
<p>I do not feel sorry that this pandemic caused so much death &amp; pain, its not healthy but true.</p>
